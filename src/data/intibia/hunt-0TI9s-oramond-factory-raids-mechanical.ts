  strategy: 'One thing to remember is that raids take place every hour after servers have come up and it is random which one you will find active. Once raid starts it only lasts for around 45 minutes.\n\n🛡️ You\'ll be taking mostly physical damage in this spawn as well as quite a bit of energy damage. There are some other elemental damage types but they are all pretty negligible. You will want to wear an Enchanted Pendulet while hunting here. Other energy protection could be helpful but is not necessary.\n\n⚠️ You\'ll want to be careful in this spawn whenever another wave drops in. If you are in middle of room when a bunch of creatures spawn on top of you you will be taking a lot of damage.\n\n🐗 This is a great spawn for completing Walker and High Voltage Elemental in Bestiary. You will complete High Voltage Elemental faster in Warzone 5 but you will get more than enough kills here if your aim is to complete Walker.',
