  strategy: 'Depending on the vortice you used, you can be teleported to three places. Check 0:54 📹 to understand how to get to the hunting place.\n\n🐗 When hunting in the Otherworld you will find Breach Brood, Dread Intruder, Reality Reaver, and Sparkion. You could start hunting this spawn as early as level 400 if you have the right gear but you will have to be careful.\n\n🛡️ If you wanted additional protection though you could use either a Pristmatic Ring which is 10% physical and 8% energy protection or a Ring of Souls which has 2% physical and 10% life drain protection. For a trinket you could either use Bone Fiddle or Moon Mirror. These will probably reduce about the same amount of damage overall.',
