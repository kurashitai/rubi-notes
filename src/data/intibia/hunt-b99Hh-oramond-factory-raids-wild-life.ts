  strategy: 'One thing to remember is that raids take place every hour after servers have come up and it is random which one you will find active. Once raid starts it only lasts for around 45 minutes.\n\n🛡️ You\'ll be taking mostly physical damage in this spawn followed by earth, life drain, and energy damage. The earth damage is quite high at around 25% so you may want to run Powerful Snake Skin imbuement if you are a lower level or new to spawn. It is also a great spawn to use Sleep Shawl, Lion Spangenhelm, and a Living Vine Bow.',
