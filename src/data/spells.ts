It does only one-fourth of damage to players, from the amount of damage it does to creatures.\n\nThe damage is not based upon the melee skill level of the type of weapon you are wielding, but rather on the highest melee skill level of your character. So if you want to effectively use this spell, then the smart play is to always try to use it when in a [[Blood Rage]]. The damage range is wide. For a single loose reference point, a level 350 with 100 skill level will cause between 580 and 880 total damage.\n\nUseful for long-winded single battles, as it can supersede the damage of [[Brutal Strike]] after 5 - 6 turns. Also useful for continuously turning invisible creatures visible again."

Levitate does not have this issue.<br />'''Warning note''': In some places you can levitate up or down after cuting grass but if the grass grows back again you won't be able to levitate over it, and you will end up trapped.\n\nTry the spell on flat walls or in front of doorway openings. The caster must be facing the cliff, wall or entrance for this spell to work.  The caster cannot move up or down more than one level at a time.  If this spell is cast and the character is not in the correct square to levitate, then no mana is lost."
